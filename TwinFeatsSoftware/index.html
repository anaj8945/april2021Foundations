        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Twin brothers Kent & Kevin Smotherman founded TwinFeats Software in 1983 with a simple premise:
            Free software for a free world. From the beginnings on the Commodore 64 to today's Android apps, that 
            vision has never wavered.

                Kent Smotherman has 38 years of professional development experience using over a
                dozen programming languages. He enjoys teaching web development, chess, and 
                petting the family cat, Solo (obviously), though he is not a Bond villain.

        <p>
            TwinFeats Software creates innovative, custom web applcations which will meet 
            exceed expectations. We will work with you to fully understand your needs,
            but more than that- your data. Web applications are all about data, and without
            deeply understanding the needs of your data, your web application will suffer.
        </p>
        <h2>Web application? Huh?</h2>
        <p>
            Web sites are static. The content they display doesn't change dynamically. A web
            application is a web site powered by a database. Facebook is a great example of
            a web application - the data shown varies by user and can change every single 
            second.

                We've written so many applications in the last 35+ years that we have literally 
                lost count! Applications like our FreedomWare line of games for the Commodore 
                64 are long gone, as are our productivity suite for GEOS on the C64 and Amiga.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ever use WebEx, GotoMeeting, or Zoom teleconferencing software? We wrote 
                our own back in the 90s for not just conferencing, but online learning. Our 
                Android applications range from custom games to productivity tools. Web sites 
                and web applications? We've done 'em by the dozens.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we like to say, if we can't do it at TwinFeats Software, its a hardware problem!
